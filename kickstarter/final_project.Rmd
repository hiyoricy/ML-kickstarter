This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(plyr)    
multMerge = function(mypath){
  filenames = list.files(path = mypath, full.names = TRUE)
  datalist = lapply(filenames, 
                    function(x){read.csv(file = x,
                                         header = TRUE,
                                         stringsAsFactors = FALSE)})
  Reduce(function(x,y) {merge(x, y, all = TRUE)}, datalist)
}

my_data <- multMerge("Kickstarter_2019-11-14T03_20_27_004Z")

```

```{r}
my_data
```



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
